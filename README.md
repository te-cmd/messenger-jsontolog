# Messenger JSON → Log

Personal project: A small website that lets me upload Messenger `.json` files and convert them into a readable log.  
It also shows stats (message counts, swears (uneditable, unless i'm the one), etc.) and allows downloading as a `.log` file.

## Notes for me
- Messenger export:  
  Messenger → Profile → Privacy & safety → End-to-end encrypted chats → Message Storage → Download Secure storage data → Download File.
