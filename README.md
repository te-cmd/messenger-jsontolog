# Messenger JSON → Log

Personal project: A small website that lets me upload Messenger `.zip` or `.json` files and convert them into a readable log.  
It also shows stats (message counts, swears, etc.) and allows downloading as a `.log` file.

## Notes for me
- Messenger export:  
  Messenger → Profile → Privacy & safety → End-to-end encrypted chats → Message Storage → Download Secure storage data → Download File.
- Inside the `.zip`:  
  - JSON files are at root.  
  - `media/` folder contains images, videos, audio, etc.  

## To run
Just open `index.html` in a browser, or host it with GitHub Pages if needed.
